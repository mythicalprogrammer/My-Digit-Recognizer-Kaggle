# Digit Recognizer Kaggle's Competition

Just me doing another [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). 

It's the classic MNIST dataset. It let's me practice my deep learning skill and keras.

Also my directory layout is base on [cookiecutter layout](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#directory-structure).
